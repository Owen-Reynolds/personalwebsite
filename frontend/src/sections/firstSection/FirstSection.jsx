                <h2>Hello World, I'm Owen</h2>
                <p>I am currently a junior at Ashland University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. 
                    I am passionate about software engineering, web development, and AI. 
                    I also completed my A.A. in Business Administration prior to attending Ashland University.
