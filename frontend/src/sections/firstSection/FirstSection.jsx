                <p>
                    I am currently a junior at Ashland University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. 
                    I am passionate about software engineering, web development, and AI. 
                    I also completed my A.A. in Business Administration prior to attending Ashland University. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy exercising, spending time outdoors, and playing basketball.

                    Over the past few years, I have developed a strong foundation in the world of Computer Science.
                    In this time I have learned a variety of programming languages, tools, and concepts. I have also completed
                    classes in data structures, database management, and the basics of artificial intelligence.
